      The actor belongs on the query or changeset while it is being prepared,
      not on the call that runs it. Changes, validations and preparations run
      during `for_read/3` and `for_action/4`; an actor supplied only at
      execution time is invisible to all of them.

          # bad — preparations ran without an actor
          Post
          |> Ash.Query.for_read(:feed, %{})
          |> Ash.read!(actor: actor)

          |> Ash.Query.for_read(:feed, %{}, actor: actor)

      Only the two-argument form is reported, where the first argument is a
      query or changeset that was already built. When a resource module or a
      record is passed with params — `Ash.create!(Post, params, actor: actor)`,
      `Ash.update!(post, params, actor: actor)` — Ash builds the changeset from
      those same options, so the actor is present the whole time and there is
      nothing to fix.
