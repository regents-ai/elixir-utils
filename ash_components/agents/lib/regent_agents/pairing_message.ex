defmodule RegentAgents.PairingMessage do
  @moduledoc """
  What a person pastes to their agent to pair it: that the account is their
  Regents Labs account and which site they pair it on, the pairing code, where
  the pairing steps are and how long the code lasts. ChatGPT and Claude, the
  hosted runtimes, are told to pair through the site's hosted connection
  instead. Every other agent is told to keep its own key, in a folder named after its runtime under
  `~/.siwa-agent`, so agents sharing one computer pair as separate agents; an
  agent on an unlisted runtime, or on none named, names the folder itself. Grok
  Bot keeps its key in `/workspace/.siwa-agent`, the one folder its computer
  keeps after a restart, as its agent guide says.
  Codex, Grok Bot, Hermes and Muse each get one more line for the mistake that
  agent most often makes on its first pairing. Muse runs where siwa.regents.sh
  may not answer, so its line names the SIWA service's other address.

  A site may add its own lines for that agent (`setup`), such as how it checks
  in. A pairing link that names the page the agent should begin on (`start`, a
  path on the same site) ends the message by sending it there once it is paired.
