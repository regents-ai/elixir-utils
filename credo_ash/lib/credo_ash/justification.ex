defmodule CredoAsh.Justification do
  @moduledoc """
  Shared handling for escape hatches that are allowed when they are explained.

  Some findings are not defects on their own — going around Ash, or turning
  policies off, is occasionally the right answer. What makes them safe is a
  reader being able to tell a deliberate choice from an accident, so a comment
  next to the line clears the finding.
  """

  @doc """
  Whether the given line has been explained by a comment.

  The unit is the enclosing function, not the single line. People document a
  cleanup block once and then write five deletes under it, and demanding a
  repeated comment above each one would produce noise rather than clarity. So a
  comment anywhere inside the enclosing `def`/`defp` — or in the comment block
  directly above its head — clears every finding in that function. The trade is
  deliberate: an unrelated comment in the same function will also clear them.
